            BASE64 Converter: Encoder and Decoder


The program you've downloaded works best on linux and mac.



How to use? :-
To run the program just follow the following steps,

1. Open the Terminal.
2. Navigate to the "base64_converter_(linux)" folder.
3. Run the "main.py" file using the command: 'python3 main.py' or 'python main.py'.

Alternatively, you can use someting like vs code to run the program.



Important Instructions :-

1. Keep the 'binary.dat' and 'main.py' files together in the same file.
2. The program only encodes text blocks without newline characters '\n'.
    Try to use single lines or paragraphs without newline characters.



Note from dev :-

This is my first project that I am uploading to github,
so thank you for checking out my repo.

Any type of feedback will be appreciated.
